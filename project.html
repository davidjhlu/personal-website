                <p>
                    The purpose of this app was to incentivize young people to use their savings accounts more, and in general to help them save more money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The users would set weekly or monthly savings goals to reach, and they would be rewarded if their milestones and goals were met. 
                    User login data was stored using Firebase, and users had the option to use voice commands to deposit money.

                <p>
                    The goal of this web app was to help youth with insurance pricing. Insurance felt like a subject which young people weren't really exposed to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The web app was crowdsourced, so any users of the app could share their information, and how much they're paying for a certain kind of insurance.
                    The model would predict prices for different kinds of insurance based on a property the user is trying to buy in a given area.
